1. Create a list of accounts you hold and want to keep an eye on (bank accounts, investing accounts, etc.)
2. Around the turn of the month, note the balance in the account (e.g. $1,413 in bank, $567 in investment account)
3. Continue into the future and examine the trends in these accounts (are they trending in lines with your goals?)

If desired at the start, go 1-3 months into the past so that you have more information to create plans for the future based on; otherwise, just keep an eye on this as you go!
